With enrollment in Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs) steadily declining in recent years, this analysis explored where and among whom this shift was happening. 

The anlysis uses Medicare Part D enrollment data from May 2015 and May 2025 to examine shifts in the share of beneficiaries enrolled in stand-alone PDPs versus other Medicare Part D coverage options. The data sources include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Servicesâ€™ Monthly Enrollment by CPSC and Monthly PDP Enrollment by SCC files. (https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-advantagepart-d-contract-and-enrollment-data) The analysis is conducted at the county level, allowing for geographic comparisons over time. 

To assess changes by geographic area, the analysis incorporates the Urban Influence Codes (UICs) released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2013 and 2024. (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation)
